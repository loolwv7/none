#Screw your courage,you'll screwed up everything else.

# A man's best friend is his dogma!
Whatever happened to the good old days
when sex was dirty and the air was clean?

There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear.

# If you actually look like your passport photo, you aren't well enough to travel.

If I kiss you, that is a psychological interaction.

On the other hand, if I hit you over the head with a brick, that is

Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time,

#There's something wrong here, there can be no more denying,One of us is changing, or maybe we just stopped trying,

And it's too late, baby, now, it's too late,
Though we really did try to make it,
Something inside has died and I can't hide and I just can't fake it...

It used to be so easy living here with you,
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool.

There'll be good times again for me and you,
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too?
But I'm glad for what we had and that I once loved you...

# But it's too late baby...It's too late, now darling, it's too late...

If things don't improve soon, you'd better ask them to stop helping you.

Does a good farmer neglect a crop he has planted?
Does a good teacher overlook even the most humble student?

When my fist clenches crack it open,
Before I use it and lose my cool.

Before I laugh and act like a fool.

And if I swallow anything evil,
Put you finger down my throat.
And if I shiver please give me a blanket,
Keep me warm let me wear your coat

And it might have gone on for the rest of their lives,

RULES OF EATING -- THE BRONX DIETER'S CREED
(1)  Never eat on an empty stomach.
(2)  Never leave the table hungry.
(3)  When traveling, never leave a country hungry.
(4)  Enjoy your food.
(5)  Enjoy your companion's food.
(6)  Really taste your food.  It may take several portions to
 accomplish this, especially if subtly seasoned.
(7)  Really feel your food.  Texture is important.  Compare,
 for example, the texture of a turnip to that of a
 brownie.  Which feels better against your cheeks?
(8)  Never eat between snacks, unless it's a meal.
(9)  Don't feel you must finish everything on your plate.  You
    can always eat it later.
(10) Avoid any wine with a childproof cap.
(11) Avoid blue food.

Fresco's Discovery:
        If you knew what you were doing you'd probably be bored.

        Once upon a time there was a beautiful young girl taking a stroll
	through the woods.  All at once she saw an extremely ugly bull frog seated
	on a log and to her amazement the frog spoke to her.  "Maiden," croaked the
	frog, "would you do me a favor?  This will be hard for you to believe, but
	I was once a handsome, charming prince and then a mean, ugly old witch cast
	a spell over me and turned me into a frog."
	        "Oh, what a pity!", exclaimed the girl.  "I'll do anything I can to
		help you break such a spell."
 "Well," replied the frog, "the only way that this spell can be
taken away is for some lovely young woman to take me home and let me spend
the night under her pillow."
   The young girl took the ugly frog home and placed him beneath her
pillow that night when she retired.  When she awoke the next morning, sure
enough, there beside her in bed was a very young, handsome man, clearly of
royal blood.  And so they lived happily ever after, except that to this day
her father and mother still don't believe her story.

 One evening he spoke.  Sitting at her feet, his face raised to her,
 he allowed his soul to be heard.  "My darling, anything you wish, anything
 I am, anything I can ever be...  That's what I want to offer you -- not the
 things I'll get for you, but the thing in me that will make me able to get
 them.  That thing -- a man can't renounce it -- but I want to renounce it --
 so that it will be yours -- so that it will be in your service -- only for
 you."
    The girl smiled and asked: "Do you think I'm prettier than Maggie
    Kelly?"
 He got up.  He said nothing and walked out of the house.  He never
 saw that girl again.  Gail Wynand, who prided himself on never needing a
 lesson twice, did not fall in love again in the years that followed.

The life which is unexamined is not worth living.

The problem is that it's rather difficult for me to understand whether a noun is countable or not. Jewellery for instance is countable for me. In other words I can count all my jewellery :) So I have to remember which noun is uncountable¡­

This is a good point! Sometimes you do have to learn which noun is uncountable, but there are a couple of guidelines:
a) If the noun is a concept word (like "life") they are uncountable unless you specify them in some way
b) If the noun is "mass" (i.e. not one distinct thing, but made up of a quantity of parts) it is uncountable. For example, "oil" is not one molecule, but many. "Jewellery" is another example of this: your jewellery collection is made up of many pieces.

Oh, that bright day in the dead of night,
Two dead men got up to fight.

Forty mutes to yell "Hooray"!
Back to back, they faced each other,
Drew their swords and shot each other.
A deaf policeman heard the noise,
Came and arrested those two dead boys.

Good Morning, merlyn
One day President Reagan, Chairman Brezhnev, the Pope, and a boy scout were flying together in an airplane. Right out in the middle of nowhere the plane developed engine trouble and started to go down. Unfortunately, only three parachutes could be found for the four passengers! Brezhnev grabbed one
of the parachutes and declared "Comrades, as leader of the socialist workers revolution, my life must be spared." And he jumped out of the plane. Then Reagan exclaimed "As leader of the greatest nation on earth, I must keep the world safe for democracy." And with that he too jumped to safety. Now if you are following all this (or counting on your fingers) you must see that there is only one parachute left for the two remaining passengers. The Pope looked kindly upon the boy scout and said "I have had a long and productive life, my son. You take the parachute and leave me in God's hands." "That's very kind of you," the observant scout replied, "but there is no need. Reagan just jumped out with my knapsack."

Give thought to your reputation.  Consider changing name and moving to
a new town.
Don't let nobody tell you what you cannot do;
don't let nobody tell you what's impossible for you;
don't let nobody tell you what you got to do,
or you'll never know ... what's on the other side of the rainbow...
remember, if you don't follow your dreams,
you'll never know what's on the other side of the rainbow...
                -- melba moore, "the other side of the rainbow"

Hello, friend!  You say things aren't going too well?  You say you have a 
date with your favorite girl when it starts raining so hard you can't see?  
And you're out on some back road when the car stalls and won't start, so 
you set off accross the fields, and 50 feet of barbed wire hits you right 
smack in the puss?  And then there's a big explosion behind you and you 
don't hear your girl screaming any more?  

       Well, take a walk in the sun and hold your head up high!
       You'll show the world; you'll tell them where to get off!
       You'll never give up, never give up, never give up -- that ship!

People usually get what's coming to them ... unless it's been mailed.

 When I was in college, there were a lot of four-letter words you couldn't
 say in front of girls.  Now you can say them.  But you can't say "girls".

 Never face facts; if you do you'll never get up in the morning.

If everything seems to be going well,
you have obviously overlooked something.

A mother takes twenty years to make a man of her boy,

I don't mind arguing with myself.

I am an ethasit.  Thanks God.

I don't know where we come from,
 Don't know where we're going to,
  And if all this should have a reason,
   We would be the last to know.
